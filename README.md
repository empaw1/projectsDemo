# projectsDemo
This is a collection of small hobby/passion projects I have worked on since graduating from school. They are not 'professional' work, just some python projects I work on in my free time whenever I have new ideas pop into my head.

Some of them might look like they were written by a 10 year old watching his first python tutorial on youtube, but I think they're pretty neat and were pretty fun to work on.
